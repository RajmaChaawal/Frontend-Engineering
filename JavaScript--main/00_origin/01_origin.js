//Lecture 1 => ORIGIN OF JAVASCRIPT!
// 1 - JS was originally created by Brendon Eich in 1995 at Netscape!
// -> As a result Microsoft created its own JScript for Internet Explorer!
// -> Both of these models for similar but incompatible is some significant ways!
// -> Consequentially, it became a mess for developers, because code was inconsistent for different browsers!

// 2 - ECMAScript :
// -> In 1997, Netscape submitted JavaScript to a standards organisation "ECMA International"!
// -> With a goal of creating standardized version of JS, in order to standardize the working of JS on all browsers!
// -> This standard was named ES (ECMAScript)!
// ~ ECMASCRIPT = official Specification!
// ~ JavaScript = the actual implementation of that spec in browsers!

// 3 - Revolution of ECMAScript :
// -> Cross-Browser Compatibility!
// -> Consistency for future growth!
// -> Single Reference!

// 4 - Evolution of ECMAScript Versions :
// -> ES1 (1997) -> 1st edition
// -> ES3 (1999) -> introduced regular expression, try/catch!
// -> ES5 (2009) -> strict mode, JSON support, getters/setter!
// -> ES6 (2015) -> "A big revolution" --> Arrow function, classes, promises, let, const, modules!
// -> Yearly updates afterwards till ES2024!
// -> JS is backwards compatible! (I.E. A 2089 JS code ------Works on------> 2020 engine BUT A 2020 JS code -X-X-X-Works on-X-X-X-> 2089 JS version!)
