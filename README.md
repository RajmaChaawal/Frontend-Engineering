Feel free to explore each folder to understand the progression from fundamentals to full builds.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- CSS3 for styling (including modern layouts such as Flexbox/Grid)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for logic and interaction  
- Optional: Browser DevTools for debugging, Git for version control  
- Recommended: A code editor such as VS Code, and a modern browser (Chrome/Firefox) for testing

If you like, I can generate a **badge section** (build status, license, version) or a **live demo link placeholder** for you to drop in. Would you like me to add that too?
