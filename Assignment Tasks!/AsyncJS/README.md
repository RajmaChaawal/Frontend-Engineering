# AsyncJS  
(Located in `Assignment Tasks!/AsyncJS`)

## 🎯 Overview  
This folder contains assignments and practice tasks focused on asynchronous JavaScript — exploring concepts like callbacks, promises, async/await, and API interactions. The goal is to deepen your understanding of managing asynchronous flows in JavaScript and build hands-on confidence with real-world patterns.

## 📂 Folder Structure  

AsyncJS/
├─ Callbacks/ → Basic callbacks and timing functions!
├─ Promises/ → Converting callbacks to promises, chaining, error handling!
├─ AsyncAwait (Soon)/ → Using async/await syntax, making sequential & parallel flows!
├─ API-Requests/ → Fetching data, handling responses, integrating with UI!
└─ … → Additional tasks extending asynchronous JS concepts!

🧑‍💻 How to Contribute or Expand

If you spot a bug, missing error handling, or an opportunity to refactor for clarity — feel free to submit a Pull Request.

You are encouraged to add new task folders (e.g., Task-05-WebSockets) within this AsyncJS directory; please name them clearly and include a short README inside that folder describing the assignment.

If you adapt or reuse any of the tasks in your personal portfolio or project, please credit the source (this repository) and document your changes.
