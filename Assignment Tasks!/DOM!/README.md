# DOM!  
(Located in `Assignment Tasks!/DOM!`)

## 🎯 Overview  
This folder contains assignments and practice tasks focused on the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript — exploring how to traverse, manipulate, and respond to changes in the DOM. The objective is to build solid hands-on skills with dynamic interfaces and interactive web pages.

## 📂 Folder Structure  
DOM!/
├─ Task-01-SelectingNodes/ → Basics of document selection (getElement(s)By…, querySelector)
├─ Task-02-ModifyingElements/ → Changing text, attributes, CSS styles via JS
├─ Task-03-EventHandling/ → Listening to click, input, change, keypress events
├─ Task-04-DOMTraversal-&-Manipulation/ → Navigating parent/child/sibling, creating/removing nodes
├─ Task-05-DynamicUIUpdates/ → Building interactive mini-apps: modal windows, tabs, accordions
└─ … → Additional tasks applying DOM concepts in real scenarios

*(Adjust folder names and numbers if yours differ.)*

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Covered  
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for DOM manipulation  
- Element selection methods: `getElementById()`, `getElementsByClassName()`, `querySelector()`, etc.  
- Working with element properties, attributes, text content, inner HTML  
- Event listening: `addEventListener()`, handling event objects, propagation  
- Creating, inserting, removing, cloning DOM nodes (`createElement()`, `appendChild()`, `remove()` etc)  
- Dynamic updating of UI based on user interaction (e.g., show/hide sections, responding to form input)  
- Good practices: min-imizing direct DOM access, structuring code for readability and maintainability  

## 🚀 How to Use Locally  
1. Navigate into the specific task folder you wish to explore, for example:  
   ```bash
   cd Assignment\ Tasks!/DOM!/Task-03-EventHandling

If you find a bug, a better way to structure code, or a performance improvement opportunity, feel free to raise a Pull Request.

You are encouraged to add new tasks within this folder (e.g., Task-06-DragDrop or Task-07-CanvasInteractivity) — please name them clearly and include a short README inside that task folder describing the assignment.

If you use parts of these tasks in your own portfolio or project, please attribute accordingly and optionally link back to this repository.
