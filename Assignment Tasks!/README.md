# Assignment Tasks — Summary (DOM! & AsyncJS)

## 📌 Overview  
This document provides a combined overview of two core learning directories in the **Frontend-Engineering** repository:  
- **DOM!** — focuses on DOM manipulation, traversal, events, and dynamic UI updates.  
- **AsyncJS** — focuses on asynchronous JavaScript, using callbacks, promises, async/await, and API interactions.

These directories together strengthen your foundation in interactive, dynamic, and modern JavaScript-driven frontend development.

## 📂 Directory Summaries  

### **1. DOM!**  
This directory covers everything related to interacting with the **Document Object Model** using vanilla JavaScript.

#### 🔑 Key Concepts  
- Selecting and manipulating DOM elements  
- Editing text, attributes, styles, and classes  
- Handling user interactions with events (`click`, `input`, `keydown`, etc.)  
- Creating, inserting, removing, and traversing DOM nodes  
- Building UI components such as modals, tabs, accordions, and dynamic lists  

#### 🎯 Learning Outcomes  
- Understand how the browser renders and exposes elements for manipulation  
- Build interactive pages with real-time updates  
- Write clean event-driven code  
- Structure DOM-related logic in a readable and modular way

### **2. AsyncJS**  
This directory focuses on asynchronous programming in JavaScript, a crucial skill for modern web apps that rely on network requests and timing-based operations.

#### 🔑 Key Concepts  
- Callbacks and timing functions (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`)  
- Promises, chaining, and error handling  
- Using **async/await** for cleaner asynchronous flows  
- Fetching data from APIs  
- Handling sequential vs parallel async operations  
- Integrating async logic into UI components  

#### 🎯 Learning Outcomes  
- Move from callback-based logic to modern async/await patterns  
- Understand non-blocking behaviour of JavaScript  
- Manage loading states, errors, and UI updates after async tasks  
- Build small apps that fetch and display data dynamically

## 🧠 Why These Two Directories Matter  
Together, **DOM!** and **AsyncJS** reflect the two most essential pillars of frontend engineering:

- **DOM** → *How the interface changes*  
- **AsyncJS** → *When and why the interface changes*

Mastering both means you can build responsive, interactive, real-world applications without relying on frameworks.

## 🚀 How to Explore  
1. Open any task folder inside either directory.  
2. Launch the corresponding HTML file in a browser.  
3. Inspect behaviour using Developer Tools (Console + Elements).  
4. Modify the code to deepen understanding and experiment with variations.
